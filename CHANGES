Changes in 1.3:  (January 2000)
- bugfix/enhanced support for OSF/1 and Digital Unix:
  getqcarg used wrong path to quotas file and
  NFS file systems were not recognized when in "/path@host" format in mtab
  provided by Victor Mora (Victor.Mora@ac.upc.es) and
  Alessandro Miotto (Alessandro.Miotto@cern.ch)
- added support for FreeBSD.
  provided by Kurt Jaeger (pi@complx.LF.net)
  and Jon Schewe (schewe@tcfreenet.org)
- added support for Veritas file system (VxFS) on Solaris
  provided by David Lee (T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk),
  Michael Gerdts (gerdts@cae.wisc.edu) and
  Daniel Hagerty (hag@shore.net).
  Beta-tested by John Randell Smith (jrsmith@eng.utah.edu).
- added workaround for yet another bug in Linux rpc.rquotad:
  rquotad reports grace times as absolute values instead of relative
  bug found by Seth Vidal (skvidal@phy.duke.edu)
- fixed grace time output for Y2K in test.pl
- fixed bug in group-quota patch as pointed out by asun@cobaltnet.com
  incorporated the patch into the distribution.
- fixed possible integer overflow in RPC quota block size conversions for
  very large quota limits; pointed out by Peter.Pickford (ppickfor@jaguar.com)
- added warning to Makefile.PL if config.h symlink already exists

Changes in 1.2.3:  (April 1999)
- added patch-file "group-quota.patch" that provides optional
  support for group-quotas (on some OS versions and localhost only)
- added auto-detection for AFS by Wolfgang Friebel
- fixed include path for AFS in Quota.xs

Changes in 1.2.2:  (December 1998)

  thanks to py@ecst.csuchico.edu for pointing those out.

Changes in 1.2:  (November 1998)
- added support for AIX 4.1 (thanks to Wolfgang Friebel (friebel@ifh.de)
  for providing a development account)
- added support for AFS (Andrew File System) by arla-0.13
  on the following platforms: AIX, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, IRIX 6, Linux
  with much help from Wolfgang Friebel.

Changes in 1.1.2:  (August 1998)
- changed names of tar archive and module directory
- fixed message for getqcarg failure in test.pl
- compatibility with sfio (moved fopen and fclose to seperate file)
  suggested by Christoph Lupe (lupe@alanya.m.isar.de) - yet UNTESTED
- fixed problems with Solaris automounter (ignore lofs mounts in getqcarg)

Changes in 1.1:  (August 1998)
- added support for Linux (thanks to Steve Nolan (nolansj@bookmark.com)
  for providing a development account)
- added OpenBSD 2.2 support, provided by James Shelburne (reilly@eramp.net)
- added syntax fixes (2 additional #includes) for IRIX 6.4
  provided by Subhendu Ghosh (sghosh@menger.eecs.stevens-tech.edu)
- support for IRIX xfs filesystems (additional to the older efs fs)
  provided by David Lloyd (cclloyd@monotreme.cc.missouri.edu)


Changes in 1.0:
(That's the version that's been released with O'Reillys Perl Resource Books)
- improved documentation, now provided in pod format inside Quota.pm
- finally fixed errno.h problem in Quota.pm
  Thanks to Tobias Oetiker (oetiker@ee.ethz.ch)
- added BSDI port by Jim Hribnak (hribnak@nucleus.com)
  unfortunately without RPC support.
- small fixes for OSF/1
- more hints in hints/none.h
- I've again received requests for Linux ports. However since I don't
  have access to an installation with quota support, I can't do this
  myself. I've included a config file that compiles without warnings
  on our system ("Red Hat for Sparc" or something), but I can't run it.
  If anyone gets it to work with or without RPC, please contact me.

Changes in 0.3a:
- started port for Linux 2.0; still needs some work.
  Compiles correctly, but RPC call fails.
- workarounds for HP-UX/10 bug in test script
  (SYNC without arguments doesn't work)
- some cleanup in Query.pm
  fixes 0.2a's problems with the autoloader under perl-5.003

Changes in 0.2a:
- need generic getqcarg instead of getdev, because:
- added support for Solaris, OSF/1 (which operate without access to
  the according block device) Required extensive code changes.
- getqcarg recognizes if path points into a NFS file system
- query() may take NFS path as argument (in form host:/path)

  Thanks to David Lee <T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk> for alpha-testing on Solaris
  and suggesting the two latter improvements.
