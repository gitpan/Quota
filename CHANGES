Changes in 0.2a:
- need generic getqcarg instead of getdev, because:
- added support for Solaris, OSF/1 (which work without access to block device)
  Required extensive changes to the code.
- getqcarg recognizes if path points into a NFS file system
- query() may take NFS path as argument (in form host:/path)

Thanks to David Lee <T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk> for alpha-testing and suggesting
the last two additions.
