Changes in 1.1.2:  (August 1998)
- changed names of tar archive and module directory
- fixed message for getqcarg failure in test.pl
- compatibility with sfio (moved fopen and fclose to seperate file)
  suggested by Christoph Lupe (lupe@alanya.m.isar.de) - yet UNTESTED
- fixed problems with Solaris automounter (ignore lofs mounts in getqcarg)

Changes in 1.1:  (August 1998)
- added support for Linux (thanks to Steve Nolan at bookmark.com for
  providing a development account)
- added OpenBSD 2.2 support, provided by James Shelburne (reilly@eramp.net)
- added syntax fixes (2 additional #includes) for IRIX 6.4
  provided by Subhendu Ghosh (sghosh@menger.eecs.stevens-tech.edu)
- support for IRIX xfs filesystems (additional to the older efs fs)
  provided by David Lloyd (cclloyd@monotreme.cc.missouri.edu)


Changes in 1.0:
(That's the version that's been released with O'Reillys Perl Resource Books)
- improved documentation, now provided in pod format inside Quota.pm
- finally fixed errno.h problem in Quota.pm
  Thanks to Tobias Oetiker (oetiker@ee.ethz.ch)
- added BSDI port by Jim Hribnak (hribnak@nucleus.com)
  unfortunately without RPC support.
- small fixes for OSF/1
- more hints in hints/none.h
- I've again received requests for Linux ports. However since I don't
  have access to an installation with quota support, I can't do this
  myself. I've included a config file that compiles without warnings
  on our system ("Red Hat for Sparc" or something), but I can't run it.
  If anyone gets it to work with or without RPC, please contact me.

Changes in 0.3a:
- started port for Linux 2.0; still needs some work.
  Compiles correctly, but RPC call fails.
- workarounds for HP-UX/10 bug in test script
  (SYNC without arguments doesn't work)
- some cleanup in Query.pm
  fixes 0.2a's problems with the autoloader under perl-5.003

Changes in 0.2a:
- need generic getqcarg instead of getdev, because:
- added support for Solaris, OSF/1 (which operate without access to
  the according block device) Required extensive code changes.
- getqcarg recognizes if path points into a NFS file system
- query() may take NFS path as argument (in form host:/path)

  Thanks to David Lee <T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk> for alpha-testing on Solaris
  and suggesting the two latter improvements.
