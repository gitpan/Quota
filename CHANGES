Changes in 0.3a:
- started port for Linux 2.0; still needs some work.
  Compiles correctly, but RPC call fails.
- workarounds for HP-UX/10 bug in test script
  (SYNC without arguments doesn't work)
- some cleanup in Query.pm
  fixes 0.2a's problems with the autoloader under perl-5.003

Changes in 0.2a:
- need generic getqcarg instead of getdev, because:
- added support for Solaris, OSF/1 (which operate without access to
  the according block device) Required extensive code changes.
- getqcarg recognizes if path points into a NFS file system
- query() may take NFS path as argument (in form host:/path)

  Thanks to David Lee <T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk> for alpha-testing on Solaris
  and suggesting the two latter improvements.
