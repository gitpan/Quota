Hi,

First, let me thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing this fantastic 
module that saved my life.

I wrote a script to send warning message if user's disk usage is close to or 
over their quota limit. As I couldn't find a perl script or any script which 
can handle threshold, I had to come up with this script. It uses your Quota 
module and also some code snippets from test.pl that is included with the 
module. Administrators can run this and get a full report of disk usage with a 
predefined threshold status of all users or a particular user. They can also 
use it in the crontab to send out warning messages to users whose disk usage 
reached their threshold.

Hope you consider this as worthy enough to include in your contrib directory.

I have attached the script (tar file), with a sample quotawarn.msg file which 
is a configurable template for sending mails to user. You can also download it 
from:
