Quota/INSTALL V1.0  Aug/97  tnzoerne

INSTALL
=======

1)  Generate the hints file.

 a) Should be done by Makefile.PL for all supported systems. If not and
    there is a file below hints/ for your operating system, just create
    a link named "config.h" to that file:  ln -s hints/my-os.h config.h

 b) Else, use hints/none.h to create a config.h of your own. Check which
    includes you need in the online manuals. Contact me before you try
    this, it might already be done.

    Edit Makefile.PL to maybe add/delete some libraries. Usually you'll
    need only librpcsvc for the quota RPC mechanism. If you don't have
    this library or it lacks the quota routines, #define MY_XDR in
    config.h to include the routines provided with this module. If you
    don't have /usr/include/rpcsvc/rquota.h, #include "include/rquota.h"
    If you don't need RPC at all, just #define NO_RPC.

3)  Generate the Makefile: perl Makefile.PL

4a) If Perl is already compiled and installed:  "make install"
    will compile the module, create the dynamic loadable library
    and copy all the stuff at the correct places in your perl tree.

    If you don't want to install immediately, type only "make"
    and "make install" maybe later.

4b) Else, Configure.sh will probably offer to install Quota automatically.

5)  Run "perl test/quotatest" to check if the module routines do work
    correctly. As of release 1.0 you can test the module without installing.
    Remove "use blib" if you want to test the installed version.

    contrib/ contains some additional examples. No guarantee from me that
    they do anything useful or don't format your hard drive.

6)  Before you start for another OS, type "make distclean"
