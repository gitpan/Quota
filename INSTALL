INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

Usually all you should have to do is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean

If that fails, regard the following instructions step by step.

Options:

-> If you want support for AFS, you need the arla package and the Kerberos
   libraries to make the appropriate AFS calls (tested with AFS from Transarc).
   See 2c below.

-> If you want support for group-quotas, use patch file group-quota.patch
   (e.g. by typing: cd Quota-1.2.3; patch < group-quota.patch). Group
   quotas do not work across RPC nor are they supported by all OSs;
   That's why I did not include them to the main release. For an example
   of use see contrib/test-group.pl


1)  On Linux systems make sure you have configured your kernel with quota
    support. You also need the quota utilities and headers. E.g., with
    the SuSE Linux 6.0 distribution you'll find them in package ap::quota.
    If your distribution doesn't include the package you can get it from
    ftp://ftp.etter.ch/pub/linux/kernel/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz
    (also available at other Linux mirrors). See also 2b below.

2)  Generate the hints file.

 a) Should be done by Makefile.PL for all supported systems. If not, and
    there is a file below hints/ for your operating system (maybe for a
    previous release), just create a link named "config.h" to that file:
    ln -s hints/my-os.h config.h

 b) Else, use hints/none.h to create a config.h of your own. Check which
    #includes you need in the online manuals. Contact me before you invest
    a lot of time, it might already be done.

    Edit Makefile.PL to maybe add/delete some libraries. Usually you'll
    need only librpcsvc for the quota RPC mechanism. If you don't have
    this library or it lacks the quota routines, #define MY_XDR in
    config.h to include the routines provided with this module. If you
    don't have /usr/include/rpcsvc/rquota.h, include "include/rquota.h"
    instead. If you don't need RPC at all, just define NO_RPC.

    On Linux you should keep #define LINUX_RQUOTAD_BUG as long as you
    don't have a correctly working rpc.rquotad. To achieve that, simply
    replace line 58 in rquota_server.c "*blksize = st.st_blksize;" with
    "*blksize = 1024;" and recompile.

 c) If you want support for AFS, you first need to install the Arla
    package (for Linux be sure to install the static libs too). Then
    edit the hints file by inserting your paths to the Kerberos library
    and headers at the appropriate places. The Makefile.PL tries to detect
    automatically if AFS is preset on a system. If that fails, edit
    the Makefile.PL to always define $hasafs (and drop me a mail).

3)  Generate the Makefile: perl Makefile.PL

4)  Compile the module: make

5)  Run "make test" to check if the module routines do work correctly.
    (Since release 1.0 you can test the module without installing)

    The contrib directory contains some additional examples, donated by
    users. No guarantee from me that they do anything useful or don't
    format your hard drive.

6)  To install the module in your perl tree:  "make install"
    You may need to su root before this step.

7)  Before you start for another OS, type "make clean"

Please mail me any changes in the hints files or Makefile.PL you had to
apply to get the package to compile.
