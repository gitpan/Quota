Quota/INSTALL V1.1  Aug/98  TOMZO

INSTALL
=======

Usually all you should have to do is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean

If that fails, regard the following instructions step by step:

1)  On Linux systems make sure you have compiled your kernel with quota
    support. You also need the quota utilities and headers installed from
    ftp://ftp.etter.ch/pub/linux/kernel/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz
    (also available at other Linux mirrors). See also 2b below.

2)  Generate the hints file.

 a) Should be done by Makefile.PL for all supported systems. If not and
    there is a file below hints/ for your operating system, just create
    a link named "config.h" to that file:  ln -s hints/my-os.h config.h

 b) Else, use hints/none.h to create a config.h of your own. Check which
    #includes you need in the online manuals. Contact me before you invest
    a lot of time, it might already be done.

    Edit Makefile.PL to maybe add/delete some libraries. Usually you'll
    need only librpcsvc for the quota RPC mechanism. If you don't have
    this library or it lacks the quota routines, #define MY_XDR in
    config.h to include the routines provided with this module. If you
    don't have /usr/include/rpcsvc/rquota.h, #include "include/rquota.h"
    If you don't need RPC at all, just #define NO_RPC.

    On Linux you should keep #define LINUX_RQUOTAD_BUG as long as you
    don't have a correctly working rpc.rquotad. To achive that, simply
    replace line 58 in rquota_server.c "*blksize = st.st_blksize;" with
    "*blksize = 1024;"

3)  Generate the Makefile: perl Makefile.PL

4a) If Perl is already compiled and installed:  "make install"
    will compile the module, create the dynamic loadable library
    and copy all the stuff at the correct places in your perl tree.

    If you don't want to install immediately, type only "make"
    and "make install" maybe later.

4b) Else, Configure.sh will probably offer to install Quota automatically.

5)  Run "make test" to check if the module routines do work correctly.
    (Since release 1.0 you can test the module without installing.
    Remove "use blib" if you want to test the installed version.)

    contrib/ contains some additional examples, donated by users.
    No guarantee from me that they do anything useful or don't format
    your hard drive.

6)  Before you start for another OS, type "make distclean"
