INSTALL
=======

1a) If there is a file below hints/ for your operating system, just create
    a link named "config.h" to that file:  ln -s hints/my-os.h config.h

1b) Else, use hints/none.h to create a config.h of your own. Check which
    includes you need in the online manuals. Contact me before you try this,
    it might already be done.

2)  Edit Makefile.PL to maybe add/delete some Includes or Libraries
    Normally you'll need only librpcsvc for the quota RPC mechanism.
    If you don't have this library of it isn't shared, define MY_XDR
    in config.h to include the routines provided with this module.
    If you don't need RPC anyways, just define NO_RPC.

3)  Generate the Makefile: ./Makefile.PL

4a) If Perl is already compiled and installed: make; make install
    Will compile the module, create the dynamic loadable library
    and copy all the stuff at the correct places of you perl tree.

4b) Else, Configure.sh will probably offer to compile Quota automatically.

5)  Run test/quotatest to check if the module routines do work correctly
    You'll have to insert the correct path to your perl binary in the
    first line of this script.
